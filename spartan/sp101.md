## WEEK 3

**The DELTA+Model **

- is comprised of seven elements that must evolve and mature for organizations to succeed in their Analytics initiatives.

These seven elements are:  
D for integrated, high-quality, and easily accessible *data*  
E for managing Analytics resources in a coordinated fashion across the *enterprise*   
L for strong, committed *leadership* that understands the importance of analytics and constantly advocates their use in decision and actions   
T for selecting the right, strategic, organizational *targets* that will be the core of an Analytics roadmap     
A for nurturing high-performing *analytics professionals*    
    
The continued growth of big data and the introduction of new Analytics techniques like machine learning provided the + in the DELTA+ model:   
    
T for the *technologies* that will support Analytics across the organization    
A for the various *analytical technique*s ranging from simple descriptive statistics to machine learning Let’s look at each of these elements.   
   
As we go through them, do a self-assessment of where you think your organization is.   
   
**D is for Data.**    
    
It is no secret that many organizations face data quality issues.    
    
For meaningful Analytics to happen, organizations must ensure that high quality data is organized and accessible by the right people.    
   
Make an assessment about Data in your organization:   
     
   
Level 1: Inconsistent, poor-quality, and unstandardized data; difficult to do substantial analysis; no groups with strong data orientation   
   
Level 2: Standardize and structured data, mostly in functional or process silos; senior executives do not discuss data management     
   
Level 3: Key data domains identified, and central data repositories created   
   
Level 4: Integrated, accurate, common data in central repositories; data still mainly an IT matter, little unique data    
     
   
Level 5: Relentless search for new data and metrics leveraging structured and unstructured data (e.g., text, video); data viewed as a strategic asset  
   
  
   
**E is for Enterprise.**  
   
  
   
Analytical organizations advocate a single and consistent perspective for Analytics across the enterprise. This is accomplished by setting an Analytics strategy and building a roadmap to implement that strategy.  
   
Make an assessment about your organization as an analytical Enterprise:   
   
Level 1: No enterprise perspective on data or analytics; poorly integrated systems  
   
Level 2: Islands of data, technology, and expertise deliver local value   
   
Level 3: Process or business unit focus for analytics; infrastructure for analytics beginning to coalesce   
   
Level 4: Key data, technology, and analytics professionals managed from an enterprise perspective  
   
Level 5: Key analytical resources focused on enterprise priorities and differentiation  
   

**L is for Leadership.**  
   
Analytical organizations have leaders who fully embrace  
   
Analytics and lead company culture towards data-driven decision-making.  
   
Beyond the C-level, all levels of leadership within the enterprise should support Analytics.  
   
  
   
Make an assessment about Leaders in your organization:   
   
Level 1: Little awareness of or interest in analytics   
   
Level 2: Local leaders emerge but have little connection   
   
Level 3: Senior leaders recognize importance of analytics and developing analytical capabilities  
   
Level 4: Senior leaders develop analytical plans and build analytical capabilities   
   
Level 5: Strong leaders behave analytically and show passion for analytical competition  
   

**T is for Targets.**  
   
Analytics efforts must be aligned with specific, strategic targets that are also aligned with the objectives of the organization.     
   

At the highest maturity level, these targets become embedded in the strategic planning process and are considered business initiatives and not just Analytics initiatives.  
   

Make an assessment about the Targets in your organization:  
   
Level 1: No targeting of opportunities   
   
Level 2: Multiple disconnected targets, typically not of strategic importance  
   
Level 3: Analytical efforts coalesce behind a small set of important targets   
   
Level 4: Analytics is centered on a few key business domains with explicit and ambitious outcomes  
   
Level 5: Analytics is integral to the company’s distinctive capability and strategy  
   
  
   
**A is for Analytics Professionals.**  
   
Organizations require analytical talent that covers a range of skills and roles as we have learned in this course.  
   
Once the right people are in place, keeping them motivated with creative and challenging projects is crucial.  
   
Make an assessment about Analytics Professionals in your organization:   
   
Level 1: Few skills that are attached to specific functions   
   
Level 2: Unconnected pockets of analytics professionals; unmanaged mix of skills  
   
Level 3: Analytics professionals recognized as key talent and focused on important business areas   
   
Level 4: Highly capable analytics professionals explicitly recruited, developed, deployed, and engaged  
   
Level 5: World-class professional analytics professionals; cultivation of analytical amateurs across the enterprise  
   

**T is for Technology.**  
   
As the technology for Analytics rapidly evolves, an organization’s ability to deploy and manage the underlying infrastructure, tools, and technologies become increasingly important.  
   
Make an assessment about Technology in your organization:  
   
Level 1: Desktop technology, standard office packages, poorly integrated systems   
   
Level 2: Individual analytical initiatives, statistical packages, descriptive analytics, database querying, tabulations   
   
Level 3: Enterprise analytical plan, tool and platforms; predictive analytical packages  
   
Level 4: Enterprise analytical plan and processes, cloud-based big data   
   
Level 5: Sophisticated, enterprise-wide big data and analytics infrastructure, cognitive technologies, prescriptive analytics  
   

**A is for Analytical Techniques.**  
   
With rapidly evolving technology comes a higher level of sophistication from the various analytical techniques that organizations may use in their decision-making process.  
   
This could range from simple descriptive statistics to machine learning.  
   

Make an assessment about Analytical Techniques in your organization:   
   
Level 1: Mostly ad-hoc, simple math, extrapolation, trending   
   
Level 2: Basic statistics, segmentation, database querying, tabulations of key metrics are leveraged to gain insights   
   
Level 3: Simple predictive analytics, classification and clustering, dynamic forecasts  
   
Level 4: Advanced predictive methods deployed to discover insights, advanced optimization, sentiment analytics, text and image analytics   
   
Level 5: Neural nets and deep learning, genetic algorithms, advanced machine learning  



### The Organizational Maturity Model
   
Organizations mature their analytical capabilities as they develop in the seven areas of DELTA+.

As introduced in “Competing on Analytics” and developed in “Analytics at Work,” this maturity model helps organizations measure their growth across these areas.    

At Level 1, the organization is Analytically Impaired. The organization lacks one or several of the prerequisites for serious analytical work, such as data, analytical skills, or senior management interest.   

At Level 2, the organization has Localized Analytics. There are pockets of analytical activity within the organization, but they are not coordinated or focused on strategic targets.   

At Level 3, the organization has strong Analytical Aspirations. The organization envisions a more analytical future, has established analytical capabilities, and has a few significant initiatives under way, but progress is slow—often because some critical factors have been too difficult to implement.   

At Level 4, the organization becomes an Analytical Organization. The organization has the needed human and technological resources, applies analytics regularly, and realizes benefits across the business. But its strategic focus is not grounded in analytics, and it hasn't turned analytics to competitive advantage.    

At Level 5, the organization is an Analytical Competitor. The organization routinely uses analytics as a distinctive business capability.

It takes an enterprise-wide approach, has committed and involved leadership, and
has achieved large-scale results.   

So how does your organization fare?   

Where do you see strengths in your organization and where do you also see areas for improvement?
