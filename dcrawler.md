“INTERFACE”

He read it aloud inside his head, realizing that his mouth could not speak as he was submerged in a viscous fluid. As he read the first word the light disappear.
 
“Where did it go? I just read it, what happened?” He asked, “Interface?” He says it again and the light glows back; the interface appears in front of his face.

He discovers how to make it appear and disappear.

Reading the interface,he can see his name. It shows up as Qing, however, that name does not sound familiar to him. He also read that his race is a Zu'Ma and he has no idea what it means.

He found himself that he could read and the reason why he could read is unknown to him.
