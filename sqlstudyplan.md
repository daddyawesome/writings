## SQL STUDY PLAN

### **(1) Complete the Entire Course at SQLZoo.net**

In the first phase, you'll complete the  [SQLZoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) course. This free, online course has been around for 20 years and many SQL gurus learned to code with it. It has you learning by doing, writing SQL queries from the very beginning.

Complete all 12 lessons and their corresponding quizzes on SQLZoo. Then go through the "Reference, How to..." section. By the end of these sections, you'll be able to (1) query databases, (2) create and modify databases, and (3) import databases into MySQL.

It took me 18 to 20 hours of dedicated study time to complete the SQLZoo course, and I think I was moving pretty slowly. I recommend working on it in chunks, by dividing your study time into three 6-hour days to get through it as quickly as possible. If you decide to retake the course (I do recommend completing it twice) it shouldn't take you more than six or seven hours. Trust me, it's worth it!

[Read about my experience using SQLZoo here](https://www.sqlbot.co/blog/sqlzoo). I offer some useful tips for getting through the course.

SQLZoo is amazing. Free, awesome, and helpful.

### **(2) Complete 2 More Free SQL Courses from  [SQLCourse.com](http://sqlcourse.com/)**

In the next phase of learning, you'll move onto the two free courses from  [SQLCourse.com](http://www.sqlcourse.com/):

-   [SQLCourse.com](http://www.sqlcourse.com/)
-   [SQLCourse2.com](http://www.sqlcourse2.com/)

Work through these courses in long chunks of time like you did with SQLZoo. In these courses, you'll encounter the same concepts you learned in SQLZoo, and you'll cover concepts like aggregate functions, combining conditions, Boolean operators, table joins and more. If you feel like you need additional review, repeat SQLCourse2. Remember, repetition is a good thing while learning SQL because it makes the language feel like second nature.

With the right focus and dedication, you can complete the first two steps in 30 days or less. Then it's time for SQL graduate school: Search for employment that uses your SQL knowledge.

[SQLCourse.com](http://sqlcourse.com/)  also offers free SQL lessons

### **(3) Search for Employment that Uses Your SQL Knowledge**

Using SQL on a daily basis is the best way to skyrocket your coding skills. That's why phase "3" of your learning process involves finding a part-time job that uses your SQL knowledge. This is your graduate school. To help you prepare for the job interview, make sure to read this blog post:  [SQL Interview Questions: 13 Top Questions You Need to Cram For](https://www.sqlbot.co/blog/sql-interview-questions).

[Search Indeed.com for entry-level SQL jobs](https://www.indeed.com/q-Entry-Level-SQL-jobs.html)  that you can do remotely from home. Don't focus on pay. Focus on practice. That this part-time job is the final stage of your SQL learning journey. The extra cash it brings is just a bonus! What you need more than anything is experience practicing with SQL. After a few months of practice, you can demand a much higher salary.

As word of encouragement, for your job search, take  [this message from software development engineer, Shantanu Vichare](https://www.quora.com/Is-learning-SQL-going-to-help-me-get-a-job-How-long-would-it-take-me-to-be-really-good-at-it), to heart:

> _Of course! Learning SQL could land you a job in the Database Industry. To be good At SQL might depend on how many hours a day you put into learning. Knowing and implementing the concepts will be a fast way to learn and understand SQL faster. I would say a month to learn the basic concepts if you are completely new to SQL. And then if you further want to learn Database Administration that might take a few more months as the scope is wide. Mind me, learning SQL could be fruitful if you want expertise in it._

> _Keep Learning!_

You now have all the tools to learn SQL at your fingertips. If you immerse yourself in SQLZoo and SQLCourse, 30 days from now you could be punching out code while earning extra money in a part-time, remote SQL job. If you have any questions during your learning journey, please don't hesitate to send me a note.
